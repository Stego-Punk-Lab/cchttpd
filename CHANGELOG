pcapHTTPd ChangeLog:

----------------- version 0.x --------------------------------

0.2.3: ???, ??? LOC
 - several(!) more bugfixes
 - introduced file size transfer limit of 4GBytes
 - general code clean-up

0.2.2: Wed, Sep-28-2023, 3690 LOC
 - serveral bugfixes; made sure code runs on current OS versions
 - created pcap module
 - modified/extended Makefile, configure script etc.
 - port back to OpenBSD
 - enable pcapng format parsing
 - sending process of files is now buffered

0.2.0: Sat, Mar-29-2008, 23:31 CET, 2797 LOC
 - added path protection (GET /../../../etc/passwd and the like)
 - max num of connections (mutex'ed)
 - c module loader now uses mutexes too
 - TCP_CORK socket option now in use + some other performance
   improvements (replaced unneded strlen() calls, replaced recv()
   and send() where it made sense). sendfile() was already in use
   but in future I need to work on something for *BSD, Solaris and
   the like.
 - ~55.000 req/10 sec on my old laptop, using -parallel 200 and
   ~44.000 req/10 sec on my old laptop, using -parallel 100 and
   only one URL with httpload. now I am faster than apache 2.2
   (that takes ~37.000 req/10 sec) but far away from being perfect.

0.1.0: Fri, Mar-21-2008, 23:19 CET
 - first more or less useable version
 - ~28.000 req/10 sec on my old laptop, using -parallel 100 and
   only one URL with httpload

0.0.0-Project-Start: Sun, Mar-09-2008, 22:30 CET
 - Just had the idea. Let's switch into the C hack mode.
